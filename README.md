Simple Search: Enter the minimum and maximum date to see sales between them. This search will show the total sales, a list with each sale
and their registration (Id, Date, Seller, Department, Amount, Status). All sorted by data. It has a navigation bar to make other searches on the same page.

<br />
Grouping Search: This function is similar to the Simple Search, the difference between them is that in the Grouping Search you will see 
containers with the sales of each department.
